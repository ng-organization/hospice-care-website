## 5. Death With Dignity

```markdown
# Death With Dignity

## Our Philosophy
Hospice care is not giving up. When all treatment options have been exhausted or methods are no longer effective, hospice care provides another way for patients to live comfortably, peacefully, and with dignity without curative care.

## The Benefits of Hospice
The benefits of hospice bring strength to patients and their caregivers.

## Decision Making Process
### Who Makes the Hospice Care Decision?
Patients, family members, and healthcare providers make the hospice care decision together. This is a medical care decision.

- If the patient can clearly communicate, the hospice team develops a care plan that respects the patient's wishes
- If the patient cannot make decisions or communicate, the patient can designate someone to make medical decisions
- Usually the spouse first, followed by adult children

## Eligibility Determination
Physicians determine if a patient qualifies for hospice care based on:
- Terminal prognosis of six months or less
- Declining functional status
